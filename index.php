	<body><p> Amber is 26 years old. She is a personal assistant for a real-estate agent. She has been married to her
			husband Brain for 5 years and they have a 3 year old daughter named Lindsey. She mostly uses her I phone for
			all her technical  needs. Amber makes custom baby bibs on the weekends and in her free time. She started
			selling bibs to her friends and family and thinks she could make a bigger profit if she could get more people
			to see her product.
			Frustrations
			Amber feels frustratrated with the negative feed back customers give because of the websites customer service
			inability to mediate problems between other buyers and sellers. She feels like this drives business elsewhere.
			Also because esty now allows manufactured products on the site she feels she has loss sales because of it.
			Amber joined the site with hopes of doing something she enjoys, making some extra money and clothing pudgy
			little babies with stylish and chic bibs.

			'Need to know'
			Amber works a full time job and is a busy mother, she appreciates easy to use templates to build her online
			store. A mobile user friendly site with options to be creative and productive is very helpful to her lifestyle.
			Scenarios
			Saturday midmorning Amber is doing the weekly family grocery shopping, she receives an alert on her phone about
			a purchases made on her esty site. She is absolutely thrilled that she can execute selling her product online
			without it interfering with her daily activities.
